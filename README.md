# WPF Spreadsheet Samples (`wpf-spreadsheet-samples`)

A comprehensive collection of C# WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) sample applications demonstrating the features, formula engine, and data-management capabilities of the **MindFusion.Spreadsheet for WPF** control.

**Excel-Free Spreadsheet Operations:** MindFusion.Spreadsheet provides WPF applications with the ability to create, open, edit, calculate, and export spreadsheet documents natively **without requiring Microsoft Excel** to be installed on the machine.

All sample projects in this repository are pre-configured to reference the official **[MindFusion.Spreadsheet.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MindFusion.Spreadsheet.Wpf/) NuGet package** directly rather than referencing local files. This enables automatic package restore and seamless out-of-the-box building.
